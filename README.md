# React Native Intermittent Crash Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug leading to intermittent crashes in a React Native application during API data fetching. The problem is particularly noticeable with larger datasets or unreliable network connections.

## Bug Description

The app intermittently crashes or freezes when attempting to fetch and process data from an API. The crashes are not easily reproducible, making debugging challenging.  The app might display a blank screen or become unresponsive.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app on an emulator or physical device.
4. Observe the app's behavior over time.  The crash may or may not occur immediately.

## Solution

The solution involves robust error handling and potentially optimizing data fetching to handle large responses more efficiently. The solution file provides an improved implementation.
